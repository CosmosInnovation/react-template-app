## Learn with Cosmos
This React app is built using Typescript as the main language, along with several other libraries including Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Formik (for form handling), Redux tool kit and Vite for fast development and building.

## How to use the repo:
- Clone the project and start editing it to suit your needs.
- This is a basic starter project, but I plan to continue building it and making it more robust so that anyone looking to build something quickly can clone it and use it as a foundation.
git commit -m "Add steps on how to use the app"

## Steps: 
- gh repo clone [LINK] or your preferred method to get the repository
- cd /react-template-app
- npm install 
- npm run dev
- View your app on provided local server

Note: If you have any feature requests or suggestions, please let me know. This is an ongoing project and I'm always looking for ways to improve it.
